    <h1> Chronicling the Ebb and Flow of Charlotte's Houseless Population through the Pandemic</h1>

  <p class="intro-p"> </br>In Charlotte, North Carolina, the chasm between the rich and the poor is so wide, the city has historically been coined a “tale of two cities:” one of prosperity and the other of poverty. 
     </br></br>
     The onset of the pandemic made visible one of the effects of this social stratification: <strong>“Tent City,”</strong> a cluster of encampments located at the northern end of Uptown 
     on North College, West 12th, and North Tryon streets. At its peak, Tent City was home to an estimated 150 people and spanned multiple blocks.</br>

</br></br>

<!-- 
In the shadow of the city’s rapid economic growth, 
rent burdened individuals often fail to escape eviction and houselessness. This pattern can be seen as far back as Charlotte's 1960's urban renewal, 
when the city government conducted a comprehensive tear-down of low-cost housing occupied mostly by black citizens, and then failed to replace much of it. </br></br>
Charlotte has yet to outpace this history. In 2014, 
    <a href="https://www.leadingonopportunity.org/" target="_blank">a Ghetty study</a> ranked Charlotte last out of the 50 largest US cities for upward mobility.
     With the additional onset of Covid-19, Charlotte's low-income citizens have experienced <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/news/2020/05/15/special-report--covid-19-s-impact-on-homelessness" target="_blank">increased unemployment and rent burden</a>,
      two of the largest contributing factors rates of urban houselessness.
  </br></br> -->
    On <strong>February 19th, 2021</strong>, Mecklenburg County officials issued an abatement order that gave Tent City residents 72 hours to 
    pack all their belongings and leave their encampments, citing rat infestations and fires as health risks. </br></br>

    Along with county-funded 90-day hotel stays for residents of Tent City, grassroots organizations and community nonprofit volunteer efforts
    identified temporary housing for over <strong>210 Tent City residents</strong>.
  </br></br>A long-term solution is not yet in place, but for the time being, relocated individuals have access to three meals a day,
    job supports, and mental health supports.</br></br>

<p class="intro-p">To get a better sense of how the progression of the pandemic affected Charlotte's houseless population, we looked into the recent events involving the Tent City 
  encampment. These events provide crucial context for raw population counts of Charlotte's 
  chronically houseless, which are published monthly through the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Housing & Homelessness Dashboard. </p>
