    <h1> Chronicling the Ebb and Flow of Charlotte's Houseless Population</h1>
    <h2> <i>by Annie Fu and Dana Gong</i></h2>

  <p class="intro-p"> </br>In Charlotte, North Carolina, the chasm between the rich and the poor is so wide, the city has historically been coined a “tale of two cities:” one of prosperity and the other of poverty. 
     </br></br>
     The most visible effect of this social stratification is the <strong>“Tent City,”</strong> a cluster of homeless encampments located at the northern end of Uptown 
     on North College, West 12th, and North Tryon streets.</br>
    </br>

</br></br>


In the shadow of the city’s great banking towers and rapid economic growth, 
rent burdened individuals often fail to escape eviction and homelessness. This pattern can be seen as far back as Charlotte's 1960's urban renewal, 
when the city government conducted a comprehensive tear-down of low-cost housing occupied mostly by black citizens, and then failed to replace much of it. </br></br>
Charlotte has yet to outpace this history. In 2014, 
    <a href="https://www.leadingonopportunity.org/" target="_blank">a Ghetty study</a> ranked Charlotte last out of the 50 largest US cities for upward mobility.
     With the additional onset of Covid-19, Charlotte's low-income citizens have experienced <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/news/2020/05/15/special-report--covid-19-s-impact-on-homelessness" target="_blank">increased unemployment and rent burden</a>,
      two of the largest contributing factors rates of urban homelessness.
  </br></br>
    Mostly recently, on <strong>February 19th, 2021</strong>, Mecklenburg County officials issued an abatement order that gave Tent City residents 72 hours to 
    pack all their belongings and leave their encampments. </br></br>
    <!-- In response to the announcement, grassroots organizations and community nonprofit volunteer efforts
    identified temporary housing for over <strong>210 Tent City residents</strong> in city hotels and emergency shelters for up to 90 days.
  </br></br>While a long-term solution is not yet in place, for the time being, relocated individuals have access to three meals a day,
    job supports, and mental health supports. -->

<p class="intro-p">To get a better sense of how the progression of the pandemic affected Charlotte's homeless population, we looked into the recent events involving the Tent City 
  encampment, providing context for raw population counts of Charlotte's 
  chronically homeless, published through the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Housing & Homelessness Dashboard. </p>
